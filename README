##About this project

this project is launched for measuring speed of transmitting and unarchiving of NGSeq files from NCBI, EBI, and DDBJ.
This can be turned to simple file downloading tool and it will be a great help for researchers who want to use public NGSeq data, but it's too messy..

anyway, I open my code. 'cause there's no reason to keep this closed =)
